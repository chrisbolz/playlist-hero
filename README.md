#YouTube Playlist Hero

Youtube Playlist Hero aims to secure your YouTube playlists by saving the current state of them and informing you about deleted videos and ones newly set to private. This way you will never lose a video from a playlist again!

## Running

Run `npm run dev` after running `npm run install` to create an express server on `localhost:8044`. You have to supply your own `oauth2.keys.json` file containing Google API authorization keys when running this project yourself.

## Goals

Hosting on firebase/other service/own server
